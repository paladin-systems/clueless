# TODO - Clueless AI Assistant Improvements

## üöÄ Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Fix auto-arrange, use dnd sorting library
- [ ] Post-it notes are being added not in a random position one over the other, we should better format the position of the post-it notes when they are added
- [ ] Post-it notes are being added too fast,  we should make sure Gemini waits a bit before adding a new post-it note, so that the user can read the previous one
- [ ] Fix the selected note to z-index front
- [ ] Fix click-through on the transparent background
- [ ] Background blur effect is not working properly
- [ ] Make the AI able to edit previous notes, adding a note id
- [ ] Bug, note boomerang when drag release

## üé® Output Formatting & User Experience

### Real-time Output Management
- [ ] **Streaming Response Improvements**
  - [ ] Change the UI to be like post-it notes fade infinity scrollable list.
  - [ ] The AI can also edit previous post-it notes, so that the user can see the changes made by the AI.
  - [ ] Divide screen in sections for better readability, be able to collapse sections, ex. "Follow-up questions", "Reference Information", "Contextual Notes", etc. Need to think more about this on how to best structure it (some options are: using tabs, collapsible sections, color different the post-it notes, etc).
